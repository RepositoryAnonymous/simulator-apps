The applications code for the simulator presented in our paper (Submission #49) at the "MICRO 2024" conference.

## Paper Details

- Submission ID: #49
- Title: 
- Conference: MICRO 2024

## 1. Reproduce the test on a real GV100 GPU

* To reproduce the performance metrics of the applications from a real NVIDIA QUADRO GV100 GPU, we need to use Nsight Compute CLI. So you need to have one of the following versions of CUDA: `v11.0`, `v11.8`, `v12.0`, `v12.1`, `v12.3` or other newer versions. You can download the latest version from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=CentOS&target_version=7).

* After you have downloaded the satisfied version of CUDA and installed it, you need to replace `"YOUR SUDO PASSWD"` with your root password in the `expect.expect` file (you must have root access to your machine in this step).
